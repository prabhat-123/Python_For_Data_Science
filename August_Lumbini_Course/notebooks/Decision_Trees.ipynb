    "<li>The decision tree algorithm builds the tree in a recursive way, by selecting the best attribute to split the data at each node based on some criterion.</li>\n",
    "<li>The criterion that can be used for splitting up a decision node is information gain or Gini impurity.</li>\n",
    "<li>Information gain measures the reduction in entropy (i.e., uncertainty) of the class labels after a split.</li>\n",
    "<li>Entropy is defined as a measure of randomness or disorder of a system.</li>\n",
    "<li>Information gain and Entropy are inversely proportional to each other.</li>\n",
    "<li>When entropy increases, information gain decreases and when entropy decreases, information gain increases.</li>\n",
    "<li>Gini impurity measures the probability of misclassifying a random sample from the node.</li>\n",
    "<li>The process continues until all the instances in a node belong to the same class or until a stopping criterion is met.</li>\n",
    "<li>Stopping criterion could be maximum tree depth or minimum number of instances per leaf.</li>\n",
    "<li>The resulting tree can be used to classify new instances by traversing from the root to a leaf node, following the path that satisfies the tests at each node.</li>\n",

    "### Decision Tree For Regression\n",
    "<li>For classification, DT tries to split node by maximizing information gain incase of ID3 or minimizing gini index incase of CART.</li>\n",
    "<li>But for regression, the goal is to reduce the variance of the target variable (i.e., the dependent variable).</li>\n",
    "<li>Decision Trees works on the principle of variance reduction since the target variable is continuous.</li>\n",
    "<li>This is typically done by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the target variable and the mean value of the samples in each resulting group.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Splitting Of Node is Done in Decision Tree Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>The decision tree regressor considers all possible splits for each predictor variable and selects the one that maximizes the variance reduction.</li>\n",
    "<li>The process is repeated recursively for each resulting group until a stopping criterion is met.</li>\n",
    "<li>Common stopping criteria include a minimum number of samples required to split a node, a maximum tree depth.</li>"
